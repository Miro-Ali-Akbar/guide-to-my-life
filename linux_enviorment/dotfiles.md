# Install my dotfiles on a nonspesific linux distro
These dotfiles cover aliases and CLI tools. More documentation can be read [here](https://github.com/Miro-Ali-Akbar/dotfiles)

1. Clone the dotfiles repo `git clone https://github.com/Miro-Ali-Akbar/dotfiles`
2. Move into the folder using `cd dotfiles`
3. Install by `bash install.sh`

Any errors or missing dependencies should be displayed in the terminal to be able to error check. Make sure you install all dependencies or not chose parts of the dotfiles that require said dependencies.
