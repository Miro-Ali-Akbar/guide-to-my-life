# guide-to-my-life
Welcome to me creating guides to things i have already figured out but cant remember for long.

This will also be my experiment with learning __markdown__ *wow*

Feel free to use any guides that may be useful but i dont really know what i am doing.

## Guides done so far:
1. Setting up a lightstrip with homeassistant using local\_tuya - Can be found at **tuya_local_light_strip.md**
2. How to login to the git terminal using git cli - Can be foundd at **git_terminal_login.md**

BYE!
