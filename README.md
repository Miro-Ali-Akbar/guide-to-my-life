# guide-to-my-life
Welcome to me creating guides to things i have already figured out but cant remember for long.

This will also be my experiment with learning __markdown__ *wow*

Feel free to use any guides that may be useful but i don't really know what i am doing.

## Guides done so far:
* __Homeassistant__
	* Setting up a light strip with homeassistant using [local\_tuya](homeassistant/tuya_local_light_strip.md)
	* How to login to the git terminal using [git cli](git_terminal_login) 
* How to revert to a backup in [homeassistant](homeassistant/reverting_backup)



BYE!
